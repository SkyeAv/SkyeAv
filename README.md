# 👋 Hi! I'm [Skye Lane Goetz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skye-lane-goetz/)

I'm an **undergraduate biochemistry student**, a **part-time data scientist**, and a **researcher** based in San Luis Obispo, CA 🇺🇸. My work bridges the gap between biological sciences and computational methods, focusing on **interdisciplinary approaches** to solve complex problems. I am passionate about using data and research to advance human understanding and improve lives.

### 🔧 **Technologies & Tools**  
I have experience working with a diverse set of languages, frameworks, and tools:  

#### 📌 **Programming Languages**  
`Python` • `Julia` • `Clojure` • `SQL` • `Unix` • `Nim` 

#### 📚 **Data Science & Machine Learning**  
`PyTorch` • `Pandas` • `NumPy` • `Scikit-Learn` • `Matplotlib` • `Scipy` • `NLTK`  

#### ⚡ **Big Data & Distributed Computing**  
`Apache Spark`  

### 🌱 **What I Do**
I thrive at the intersection of biology, data, and computing, working on projects that apply:
- **Data analysis and visualization** for biological datasets
- **Machine learning** applications in biochemical research
- **Scientific computing** to model and simulate biological phenomena

### 🌿 **Interests Outside of Work**
When I'm not crunching data or researching, I love to:
- Cook up new recipes 🍲
- Explore hot springs and nature 🌿
- Forage, garden, and cultivate sustainable practices 🌻
- Go spelunking (caving) with friends 🧗‍♀️

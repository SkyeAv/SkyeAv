## Hi! I'm Skye!! (She/They)
### I'm an undergrad biochem student, part-time data scientist, and researcher in San Luis Obispo, CA. :us:
I apply systems biology to modern problems to advance human understanding and improve our lives. 

Outside, you'll find me 
* cooking,
* soaking in hot springs,
* foraging, gardening,
* or caving with friends.

**I can't wait to work with you all!**
